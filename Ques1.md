## Endpoints:


1. Retrieving Product Information:

   a. Endpoint to retrieve details of a single product by its ID:

   * Endpoint: GET /products/{product_id}
   * Functionality: Retrieves the details of a product based on its unique ID.
   * Implementation: When a GET request is made to this endpoint, the API fetches the product details from the database using the product ID and returns the product information as a JSON response.

   b. Endpoint to retrieve a list of all products, with pagination support:

   * Endpoint: GET /products
   * Functionality: Retrieves a paginated list of all products, allowing users to navigate through the entire product inventory in manageable chunks.
   * Implementation:
     * Accepts optional query parameters like "page" and "limit" to specify the page number and the number of products per page.
     * The API fetches the relevant subset of products from the database using the provided pagination parameters and returns the results along with pagination metadata.
2. Updating Product Information: a. Endpoint to update the price and stock level of a product:

   * Endpoint: PUT /products/{product_id}
   * Functionality: Allows for the update of the price and stock level of a specific product by its ID.
   * Implementation:
     * Accepts a JSON payload in the request body containing the new price and stock level for the product.
     * The API updates the corresponding product record in the database and ensures data consistency with the caching layer.
3. Searching for Products: a. Endpoint to search for products based on name or price range:

   * Endpoint: GET /products/search
   * Functionality: Enables users to search for products based on their name or within a specified price range.
   * Implementation:
     * Accepts query parameters such as "name" and "min_price"/"max_price" to filter products based on the provided criteria.
     * The API constructs and executes optimized SQL queries to fetch products matching the search criteria from the database and returns the results.


## Considerations:

1. Database Interactions:

   - Database: Utilize PostgreSQL for its strong support for complex queries, indexing capabilities, and reliability.
   - SQL Queries: Use parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks and optimize query execution plans.
   - Indexing: Apply indexing to the "id," "name," and "price" columns to speed up retrieval and searching operations.
   - Connection Pooling: Implement a connection pool management system, such as Psycopg2's connection pooling for PostgreSQL, to efficiently manage multiple concurrent database connections and minimize the overhead of connection establishment.
2. Caching Strategy:

   - Caching Layer: Implement Redis as an in-memory data store due to its high performance and support for advanced data types and caching strategies.
   - Caching Algorithm: Utilize the Least Recently Used (LRU) caching algorithm in Redis to automatically evict less frequently accessed items from the cache and make room for new data.
   - Cache Invalidation: Employ the pub/sub (publish/subscribe) feature in Redis to notify cache instances to invalidate or update cached data when product information is updated in the database. Additionally, apply Time-To-Live (TTL) settings to evict keys automatically after a specified period, ensuring data consistency.
3. Error Handling:

   - HTTP Status Codes: Return appropriate HTTP status codes such as 404 for "Not Found," 400 for "Bad Request," and 500 for "Internal Server Error" scenarios.
   - Error Response Payload: Provide descriptive error messages in the API response payload, including details and the nature of the encountered error, enabling clients to handle errors effectively.
4. Data Consistency:

   - Write-Through Caching: Implement a write-through caching strategy where write operations also update the cache, ensuring consistency between the database and the cache.
   - Database Triggers: Utilize PostgreSQL triggers to notify the cache of any relevant data changes, triggering cache updates or invalidations.
5. Scalability:

   - Backend Framework: Employ FastAPI for its asynchronous support, which allows handling a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.
   - Asynchronous Request Handling: Utilize the asynchronous handling capabilities of FastAPI and its underlying ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) to process a large number of simultaneous requests without tying up system resources.
   - Load Balancing and Horizontal Scaling: Utilize a load balancer, such as nginx, in front of multiple API server instances, distributing incoming traffic evenly. Employ horizontal scaling by adding more API server instances to handle increased load, making use of containerization and orchestration technologies like Docker and Kubernetes for effective management.

Regarding the bonus question on Rate Limiting:

- Rate Limiting Module: Integrate a dedicated rate-limiting middleware such as "fastapi-limiter" for FastAPI, or "flask-limiter" for Flask, allowing for flexible rate-limiting configuration and enforcement.
- Decision on Rate Limits: Determine appropriate rate limits based on empirical data, expected usage patterns, and capacity planning. For instance, consider setting limits such as 100 requests per minute for read operations and 50 requests per minute for write operations.
- Enforcement of Rate Limits: Enforce rate limits through the use of tokens or IP-based verification, enabling the API to restrict access for clients exceeding the predefined limits while maintaining responsiveness for compliant users.

With this detailed approach, the RESTful API will effectively handle product information, prioritize performance, and ensure robustness for frequent usage scenarios.
